# Blast-Furnace
An Angular-Material based web application framework. 

## Aims
This project's aim is to develop a reusable framework for the development of next-generation web applications. It should replace Homesite/Coke Oven as a base for my application development. It should be easy to follow in terms of architecture, code layout and functional change. It should also include the technology stack and toolchain required to deliver fully releasable code. 

## Technology stack
Blast Furnace will consist of the following technologies at the start: 
* Angular 6
* Angular CLI
* Angular Material
* Web Pack
* Sass

### Supported technologies
While not directly included in the base technology stack, Blast Furnace will be developed with the following technologies in mind: 
* Electron
* MongoDB

This will mostly be done by writing Node.js companion frmeworks to link in to Blast Furance. 

## First projects
The first project to use Blast Furance will most likely be dragonscancode.com. Followed either by TagUrImg or client sites depending on demand. 

## Migration
There are currently no plans on the migration of Homesite/Coke Oven sites to Blast Furnace. Due to the difference in tehcnology and architecture they will most likely have to be rewritten.
